# meda-env
A PettingZoo Gym-based environment for microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) biochips.

## Overview
This environment simulates the dynamic environment of a MEDA biochip. 

For furhter information, please reference our ICML'21 paper named "Parallel Droplet Control in MEDA Biochips using Ｍulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning".

## Training
First, install all the required libraries when you run meda\_env/train.py. Then you can find the training result under the 'log' directory.
